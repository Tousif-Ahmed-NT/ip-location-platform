# IP-to-Location Platform Architecture

This document outlines the architecture for a precision IP-to-location platform.

## 1. Overview

The platform will fuse best-of-breed data sources and active measurement to provide a single best-estimate location with a transparent accuracy radius and confidence level.

## 2. Components

### 2.1. Frontend (React + Tailwind UI)
- Responsive user interface with map view.
- Confidence indicators and history.
- Admin tools.
- Optional browser geolocation with user consent.

### 2.2. Backend (Node.js/Express)
- Scalable service behind an API gateway.
- **Core Geolocation Logic**: Combines authoritative databases (MaxMind GeoIP2, IP2Location), commercial APIs (ipinfo, ipstack), WHOIS/RIR lookups, reverse-DNS heuristics, and ASN checks.
- **Active Probing**: Verification and refinement via traceroutes, latency triangulation from distributed probes (RIPE Atlas or custom agents).
- **ML Model**: Weights sources to output latitude/longitude + accuracy radius and a confidence score.
- **Fraud/VPN Detection**: Cloud ASN lists, known proxy/VPN databases.
- **Privacy/Compliance**: GDPR, user consent, data retention controls.

### 2.3. Data Stores & Messaging
- **Redis**: Caching layer.
- **PostgreSQL**: Event and metadata storage.
- **Kafka (or RabbitMQ)**: Ingest and asynchronous tasks.

### 2.4. API Endpoints
- REST/GraphQL endpoints.
- Rate limiting, API keys, webhooks for integrations.

### 2.5. Admin Tools
- Pipelines to regularly refresh databases and reconcile conflicting records.

## 3. Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS, Mapbox GL JS (or similar for map)
- **Backend**: Node.js (Express.js), gRPC (for internal communication if needed)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Cache**: Redis
- **Message Broker**: Kafka (or RabbitMQ)
- **Geolocation Data**: MaxMind GeoIP2, IP2Location, ipinfo, ipstack, WHOIS/RIR
- **Active Measurement**: RIPE Atlas integration, custom probing agents
- **Machine Learning**: Python (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch) for ML model (can be integrated via microservice)

## 4. Development Plan

1. **Backend Setup**: Initialize Node.js project, set up Express, define API routes, connect to PostgreSQL and Redis.
2. **Geolocation Core**: Implement initial logic for authoritative database lookups.
3. **Active Measurement Integration**: Set up RIPE Atlas API integration and design custom probing.
4. **ML Model Integration**: Develop or integrate ML model for source weighting and confidence scoring.
5. **Frontend Development**: Build React app, integrate map, display geolocation data.
6. **Authentication & Authorization**: Implement API keys, rate limiting.
7. **Fraud Detection**: Integrate fraud/VPN detection logic.
8. **Deployment**: Containerize services (Docker), deploy to a cloud provider.
9. **Monitoring & Logging**: Set up telemetry.
